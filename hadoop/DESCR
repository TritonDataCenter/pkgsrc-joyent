The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for
the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of
computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale
up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local
computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver
high-avaiability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle
failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available
service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone
to failures.

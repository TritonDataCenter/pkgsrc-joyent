The Spice project aims to provide a complete open source solution for
interaction with virtualized desktop devices.The Spice project deals
with both the virtualized devices and the front-end. Interaction between
front-end and back-end is done using VD-Interfaces. The VD-Interfaces
(VDI) enable both ends of the solution to be easily utilized by a
third-party component.

Currently, the project main focus is to provide high-quality remote
access to QEMU virtual machine. Seeking to help break down the barriers
to virtualization adoption by overcoming traditional desktop
virtualization challenges, emphasizing user experience. For this
purpose, Red Hat introduced the SPICE remote computing protocol that is
used for Spice client-server communication. Other components developed
include QXL display device and driver, etc.

Hive is a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates easy data
summarization, ad-hoc queries, and the analysis of large datasets
stored in Hadoop compatible file systems. Hive provides a mechanism
to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like
language called HiveQL. At the same time this language also allows
traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers
and reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this
logic in HiveQL.

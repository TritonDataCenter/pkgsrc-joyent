Apache HCatalog is a table and storage management service for data created
using Apache Hadoop.

This includes:

- Providing a shared schema and data type mechanism.
- Providing a table abstraction so that users need not be concerned with
  where or how their data is stored.
- Providing interoperability across data processing tools such as Pig,
  Map Reduce, and Hive.

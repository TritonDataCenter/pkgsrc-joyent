OpenResty (aka. ngx_openresty) is a full-fledged web application server by
bundling the standard Nginx core, lots of 3rd-party Nginx modules, as well
as most of their external dependencies.

By taking advantage of various well-designed Nginx modules, OpenResty
effectively turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which
the web developers can use the Lua programming language to script various
existing nginx C modules and Lua modules and construct extremely
high-performance web applications that are capable to handle 10K+ connections.

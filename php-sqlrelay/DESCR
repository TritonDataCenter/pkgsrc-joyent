SQL Relay is a persistent database connection pooling, proxying and
load balancing system for Unix and Linux supporting ODBC, Oracle,
MySQL, mSQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Interbase,
Lago and SQLite with APIs for C, C++, Perl, Perl-DBI, Python,
Python-DB, Zope, PHP, Ruby, Ruby-DBI, TCL and Java, command line
clients, a GUI configuration tool and extensive documentation.

The APIs support advanced database operations such as bind variables,
multi-row fetches, client side result set caching and suspended
transactions. It is ideal for speeding up database-driven web-based
applications, accessing databases from unsupported platforms,
migrating between databases, distributing access to replicated
databases and throttling database access.

Use Apache HBase when you need random, realtime read/write access to your
Big Data. This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables - billions
of rows X millions of columns - atop clusters of commodity hardware. Apache
HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store modeled
after Google's Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data
by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage
provided by the Google File System, Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like
capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.

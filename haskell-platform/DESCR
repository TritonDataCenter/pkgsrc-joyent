The Haskell Platform

Comprehensive: The Haskell Platform is the easiest way to get started with
programming Haskell. It comes with all you need to get up and running. Think
of it as "Haskell: batteries included".

Robust: The Haskell Platform contains only stable and widely-used tools and
libraries, drawn from a pool of thousands of Haskell packages, ensuring you
get the best from what is on offer.

Cutting Edge: The Haskell Platform ships with advanced features such as
multicore parallelism, thread sparks and transactional memory, along with
many other technologies, to help you get work done.

stud is a network proxy that terminates TLS/SSL connections and forwards
the unencrypted traffic to some backend. It's designed to handle 10s
of thousands of connections efficiently on multicore machines.
stud has very few features. It is designed to be paired with an
intelligent backend like haproxy or nginx.

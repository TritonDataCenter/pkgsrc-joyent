Erlang is a programming language which has many features more commonly
associated with an operating system than with a programming language:
concurrent processes, scheduling, memory management, distribution,
networking, etc.

The initial open-source Erlang release contains the implementation of
Erlang, as well as a large part of Ericsson's middleware for building
distributed high-availability systems.

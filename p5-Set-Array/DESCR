Set::Array allows you to create arrays as objects and use OO-style methods on
them. Many convenient methods are provided here that appear in the FAQ's, the
Perl Cookbook or posts from comp.lang.perl.misc. In addition, there are Set
methods with corresponding (overloaded) operators for the purpose of Set
comparison, i.e. +, ==, etc.

The purpose is to provide built-in methods for operations that people are
always asking how to do, and which already exist in languages like Ruby. This
should (hopefully) improve code readability and/or maintainability. The other
advantage to this module is method-chaining by which any number of methods may
be called on a single object in a single statement.

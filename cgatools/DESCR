The Complete Genomics Analysis Tools (cgatools) is an open source
project to provide tools for downstream analysis of Complete Genomics
data.  The focus is to provide command line utilities, but a C++ API
is available as well.  The general areas of functionality include
genome comparison, format conversion, and reference tools.

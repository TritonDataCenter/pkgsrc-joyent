Templeton provides a REST-like web API for HCatalog and related Hadoop
components. Developers make HTTP requests to access Hadoop MapReduce,
Pig, Hive, and HCatalog DDL from within applications. Data and code
used by Templeton is maintained in HDFS. HCatalog DDL commands are
executed directly when requested. MapReduce, Pig, and Hive jobs are
placed in queue by Templeton and can be monitored for progress or
stopped as required. Developers specify a location in HDFS into which
Templeton should place Pig, Hive, and MapReduce results.

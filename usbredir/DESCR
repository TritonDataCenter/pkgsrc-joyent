usbredir is the name of a network protocol for sending usb device
traffic over a network connection. It is also the name of the software
package offering a parsing library, a usbredirhost library and several
utilities implementing this protocol.

usbredir was created for use with Spice, which is why it is hosted on
spice-space.org, but the protocol and the usbredirhost are completely
independent of spice, they could for example also be used to create a
vnc extension for redirecting usb devices over a vnc connection to a
qemu virtual machine.

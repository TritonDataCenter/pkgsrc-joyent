Net::DNS is a Perl interface to the DNS resolver.  It allows the
programmer to perform any type of DNS query from a Perl script.
For details and examples, please read the Net::DNS documentation page
('perldoc Net::DNS')

Features include a simple nameserver (Net::DNS::Nameserver), dynamic
DNS updates, signed queries (TSIG), support for DNAME resource records
and IPv6.

The author invites feedback on Net::DNS, especially on new features
like dynamic updates und TSIG.  If there's something you'd like to
have added, please let him know (http://www.net-dns.org/).

Future versions may contain some C to increase speed or for those who
wish to link against libresolv or libbind.

Mahout is a scalable machine learning library that implements many different
approaches to machine learning.  The project currently contains
implementations of algorithms for classification, clustering, frequent item
set mining, genetic programming and collaborative filtering. Mahout is
scalable along three dimensions: It scales to reasonably large data sets by
leveraging algorithm properties or implementing versions based on Apache
Hadoop. It scales to your perferred business case as it is distributed under
a commercially friendly license. In addition it scales in terms of support
by providing a vibrant, responsive and diverse community.

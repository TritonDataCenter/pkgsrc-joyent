This package contains a subset of binutils needed for GCC
to work properly. The rest of the toolset is provided by
the operating system (e.g. 'nm' or 'strip'). The GNU ld
linker here is provided just in case - normally the Sun
linker (/usr/bin/ld) should be used, and GCC is configured
to do so, too.

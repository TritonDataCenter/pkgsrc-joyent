OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with
all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to external libraries), all
known security bugs fixed, new features reintroduced and many other
clean-ups. More information about SSH itself can be found in the file
README.Ylonen. OpenSSH has been created by Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck,
Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and Dug Song.

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, PAM
support (for Linux and Solaris), EGD[1] support, SOCKS support (using
the Dante [6] libraries and replacements for OpenBSD library functions
that are (regrettably) absent from other unices. This port has been
best tested on Linux, Solaris, HPUX, NetBSD and Irix. Support for AIX,
SCO, NeXT and other Unices is underway. This version actively tracks
changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

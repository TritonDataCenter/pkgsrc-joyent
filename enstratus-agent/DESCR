The enStratus agent is composed of a lightweight tomcat application used for
communicating with the enStratus provisioning server and a set of associated
shell scripts. The shell scripts are responsible for executing some actions
on the server and are extensible by end users.

The agent listens on port 2003 and takes action based on user input as in
the case of adding a user to a system ( the addUser script) and also automates
actions such as attaching, formatting, encrypting, and mounting volumes as
part of a fully automated enStratus deployment. Communication to and from
the enStratus provisioning server is encrypted.

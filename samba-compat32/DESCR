This package contains libraries from the 32-bit version of net/samba4,
allowing NSS and PAM (via winbind) to authenticate to Active Directory.

Currently the illumos NSS and PAM libraries require 32-bit libraries, so
this package is necessary when using a 64-bit package set.

The two libraries of interest are:

  * lib/i386/nss_winbind.so.1 (NSS)
  * lib/samba/security/i386/pam_winbind.so (PAM)

The remaining libraries bundled in the package are dependencies of these
two libraries.

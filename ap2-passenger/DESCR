Phusion Passenger - a.k.a. mod_rails or mod_rack - makes deployment of Ruby
web applications, such as those built on the revolutionary Ruby on Rails web
framework, a breeze. It follows the usual Ruby on Rails conventions, such as
"Don't-Repeat-Yourself".

This package holds the Apache2 module only.

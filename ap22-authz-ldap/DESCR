This Apache LDAP authentication/authorization module tries to solve
the following problems that other such modules may not solve in all cases:

  * Map the short form of the distinguished name of a certificate and its
    issuer obtained from the environment of mod_ssl to a user distinguished
    name in an LDAP directory.
  * Check the age of a password in an LDAP directory, denying authorization
    in case the password is to old.
  * Authorize a user based on roles or an arbitrary LDAP filter expression.
  * Authorize a user based on whether he owns a file or belongs to the group
    owning a file.

Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists
of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled
with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property
of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial
parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle very large data
sets.

MongoDB wasn't designed in a lab. We built MongoDB from our own experiences
building large scale, high availability, robust systems. We didn't start
from scratch, we really tried to figure out what was broken, and tackle that.
So the way I think about MongoDB is that if you take MySql, and change the
data model from relational to document based, you get a lot of great features:
embedded docs for speed, manageability, agile development with schema-less
databases, easier horizontal scalability because joins aren't as important.
There are lots of things that work great in relational databases: indexes,
dynamic queries and updates to name a few, and we haven't changed much there.
For example, the way you design your indexes in MongoDB should be exactly
the way you do it in MySql or Oracle, you just have the option of indexing
an embedded field.
